# MotionMapper
===========================
The motion mapper framework can be used to process 1) kinematic data of robot/animal motion and 2) videos of robot/animal motion. The result of the framework would be a 2d embedding space that represents the robot motion. The regions with high pointâ€™s density in the space probably represent stereotyped behaviors of the robot.

The framework makes use of PCA, Morlet Wavelet, t-SNE, and Markov Chain.
